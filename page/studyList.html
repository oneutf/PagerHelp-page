        The term “case study” is often used in a business setting and conjures
        some vague marketing associations: company A did this and everything
        turned out great, while company B did that and everything was not so
        good. Yet case study is much more. It’s a way to do research, and as a
        student, you might be tasked with writing a case study analysis paper
        not only for your Business class, but for Social Studies, Education,
        Health Care, and other subjects.

      <h2>Case Study Definition</h2>
      <p class="text-muted">
        Before we start going into the particulars of how to write a case study
        analysis, let’s first figure out what a case study is.
      </p>
      <p class="text-muted">
        A case study is a detailed analysis of a specific subject – an event, a
        person, a phenomenon, etc. Its purpose is to evaluate and understand a
        research problem through its particular manifestation. For example, you
        want to find out what are the advantages and disadvantages of using
        residential solar panels. This is your research problem. For your case
        study report, you must find one or two households relying on off-grid
        solar panels, describe them, and interview the residents.
      </p>
      <p class="text-muted">
        Research methods used for case studies are predominantly qualitative,
        although some elements of quantitative may also apply.

      <h2>Steps to Writing a Case Study Paper</h2>
      <p class="text-muted">
        If you plan to conduct the case study on your own, here is a quick guide
        on how to make it the proper way.
      </p>
      <ol class="text-muted">
        <li>
          <strong>Choose</strong>
          the case to study. You may have determined the problem and now should
          look for a case to provide you with insights. Alternatively, you have
          come across an interesting case and now you want to come up with a
          problem statement and research questions. Either way, you should have
          answers to both questions: what you are going to study and why.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Identify</strong>
          key theories and concepts to guide your study. While the case study
          format is very practical and concentrates on details of a particular
          case, it still needs a theoretical framework to tie your fieldwork
          with the existing knowledge.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Conduct</strong>
          your study. Use the methods you have chosen to collect data
          (interviews, observations, analysis of official records, articles,
          media, etc.)
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Analyze</strong>
          the data and draw your conclusion. Here you make your diagnosis based
          on the data you’ve collected.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Present</strong>
          the findings. There is no one good way to present your findings. Some
          case studies resemble standard academic research papers, others might
          be done as a multimedia presentation or a narrative. Choose how you
          wish to present your case study beforehand.
        </li>
        <p>
          We will further concentrate on how to write a case study assignment in
          an APA-structured manner, with separate chapters for aims, methods,
          results, etc. However, we would like to stress one more time that this
          is not the only possible way.

      <h2>A Template for a Case Study Outline</h2>
      <p class="text-muted">
        A good case study report usually follows the standard structure of the
        research papers. For example, the outline can look like this:
      </p>
      <ol class="text-muted">
        <li>
          <strong>An introduction for a case study</strong>
          contains a short statement of your topic, the scope of your study and
          grounds for the study to be conducted. It should also explain why your
          research is relevant. Do not confuse an introduction with an executive
          summary for a case study: these are two completely different pieces of
          writing with different goals. An executive summary (in an academic
          setting more commonly known as an abstract) should briefly state the
          results of your study, while the introduction only sets the scene for
          the rest of the case study to follow.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Aims of your case study:</strong>
          here you should provide a short overview of the available literature
          on the subject, tying your practical case study with theory. Identify
          any gaps in the knowledge that you plan to address, any assumptions
          you want to challenge, or problems you plan to tackle.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>The methods of your case study</strong>
          : list the quantitative and qualitative methods you plan to use, list
          your planned observations, interviews you will need to conduct,
          questionnaires to fill out, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Results of the case study:</strong>
          here you present what you have learned and how the data obtained
          correlates with the expected results.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Discussion:</strong>
          this section contains the interpretation of your results, the analysis
          of your research (could it have been done some other way, more
          effectively?)
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Recommendations:</strong>
          your proposal for future research and any questions that were left
          unanswered.

      <h2>Business Case Study Tips</h2>
      <p class="text-muted">
        For those of you who need to write a case study for a Business degree,
        here are some tips on how to write a business case study.
      </p>
      <ol class="text-muted">
        <li>
          This type of case study examines a business’ specific challenge
          overcome or goal achieved. Business case studies vary greatly in
          volume and scope, but they all have three basic ingredients:
          <ul class="clear-list">
            <li>- Initial challenge/goal</li>
            <li>- Solution applied</li>
            <li>- Result of this solution</li>
          </ul>
          The challenge doesn’t have to be something as drastic as the survival
          of the company. It can be a growth goal, restructuring, becoming more
          profitable, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
          Before you proceed with studying your candidate, make sure you have
          their permission to write about them (if you aren’t writing about your
          own company).
        </li>
        <li>
          For the business case study, you can be more creative with the format
          and medium – it can be a video, a presentation, a podcast, an
          infographic, even a comic strip. Be as creative as you want. However,
          make sure you’ve decided on the format before you start collecting
          data.
        </li>
        <li>
          Just as with the academic study, it is important to build a solid
          theoretical framework for your study. Make sure you are asking the
          right questions.
        </li>

      <h2>How to Write a Case Study in APA Format</h2>
      <p class="text-muted">
        Now when everything is ready all that’s left to do is to make sure the
        formatting adheres to the APA format. Your paper should include:
      </p>
      <ol class="text-muted">
        <li>
          The title page with the following information:
          <ul class="list-alpha">
            <li>
              Running head preceded by the words “Running head” (on the title
              page only)
            </li>
            <li>
              The full title of your paper 12 words max
            </li>
            <li>
              Your name without prefix/suffix (Mr./Ms./Dr./Ph.D./BA/etc.)
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          An abstract summarizing your paper in 150 to 200 words, followed by
          relevant keywords
        </li>
        <li>
          Running head (aka page heading) should be present on every page
          consisting of the page number on the right margin and a shortened
          title of your case study (50 characters max, ALL-CAPS)
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p class="text-muted">
        Sounds tedious? It kind of is. The good news is you can make other
        people do formatting and other finicky tasks for you. Our writers know
        all about indentations, margins, font sizes, and can write an abstract
        with their eyes closed! Why not trust them with your case study write
        up?
